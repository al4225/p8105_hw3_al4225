## Problem 2

### Wrangling

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

**Steps**: First, I load and clean the data. Second, I create a day_type
variable to show whether the day is weekday or weekend. Third, I group
the data according to week and day_id. Forth, I use pivot_longer to tidy
the activity counts and minutes. Fifth, I round the value of activity
counts with 0 digits and change activity_minute to integer values. At
last, I adjust the order of the columns.

**Discription**: There are 50400 observations and 6 variables. Each
observation represents the activity counts for each minute of a 24-hour
day starting at midnight in the day of given week. There are some key
variables such as week, day_id, day, day_type and activity_minute and
activity_counts.

``` r
accel_data = read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv",
                col_names = TRUE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    day_type = ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")) %>%
  group_by(week,day_id) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "activity_minute", 
    values_to = "activity_counts",
    names_prefix = "activity_") %>%
  mutate(
    activity_counts = round(activity_counts, digits = 0),
    activity_minute = as.integer(activity_minute)) %>%
    select(week, day_id, day, day_type, everything())
```

### Table for total activity

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

**Steps**: Frist, I group the dataset according to week, day_id and day.
Second, I sum the activity_counts and create a total activity variable
for each day. Third, I create a table to show the totals.

**Discription**: According to the table, we can see that there are 35
total activity counts in 35 days. From week1 to week3, the total
activity counts maintain a high level and gradually increase from week1
to week2. From week3 to week5, the total activity counts tend to
decrease especially on Saturday.

``` r
accel_data %>%
  group_by(week, day_id, day) %>%
  summarize(activity_total = sum(activity_counts)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week', 'day_id'. You can override using
    ## the `.groups` argument.

### Graph

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

**Steps** First, I make a smooth plot with x = activity_minute and y =
activity_counts. Second, I add some labs and adjust the x scale. Third,
I put the theme to the bottom.

**Description**: 1.There are two evident peaks in the plot which are at
21:00 on Friday and during 9:00 to 12:00 on Sunday.  
2.The activity counts are higher on Friday and Sunday so this 63
year-old male with BMI 25 prefers to do the activity on Friday and
Sunday. 3.The activity counts decline from 21:00 to 3:00 the next day
and they increase from 3:00 to 21:00. It means that the man tends to
have a rest after 21:00.

``` r
accel_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute, y = activity_counts, color = day)) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Activity_counts plot",
    x = "Time of the day",
    y = "Activity counts"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 360, 720, 1080, 1440), 
    labels = c("0:00", "6:00", "12:00","18:00", "24:00" )
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

## Problem 3

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which
missing data is an issue. Then, do or answer the following (commenting
on the results of each):

### Data cleaning

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units.

**Steps** First, I do data cleaning. Second, I separate variables for
year, month and day. Third, I change the units of tmax and tmin from
tenths of degrees C to degrees C and the unit of prcp: precipitation
(tenths of mm) to mm.

**Discription**: After data cleaning, It is an 2,595,176 × 9 table,
there are 2595176 of observations and 9 variables in the dataset. The
key variables are id(Weather station ID), year, month, day,
prcp(precipitation(mm)), snow(Snowfall (mm)), snwd(Snow depth (mm)),
tmax(Maximum temperature (degrees C)) and tmin(Minimum temperature
(degrees C)).

``` r
ny_noaa_data = 
ny_noaa %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, into  = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year), 
         month = as.integer(month),
         day = as.integer(day), 
         month = month.abb[month],
         tmax = as.integer(tmax),
         tmin = as.integer(tmin),
         tmax = tmax / 10,
         tmin = tmin / 10,
         prcp = prcp / 10)
